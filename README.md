# AutoTyper with Random Intervals

I had this AutoTyper commissioned as I was looking for something to auto type a set amount of text at set intervals. I also wanted to add the functionality of adding some aspect of randomness to the intervals with thresholds. This open source project is free under the GNU General Public Licsense version 3 and supports Windows 10 only. 

If you enjoyed this application, please consider buying me a coffee. Thank you for your support!

# Instructions
- To use, type whatever text that you want to appear in the first text box.
- Next, write whatever delay you want that text to be resent (this box is based on seconds) and can go all the way up to 60 min (or 3600 seconds).
- Finally, for the thresholds you can change the randomness of the intervals based on the numbers you put here (based on milliseconds).
- Click the Send Enter button if you want Enter to be typed for each text
- Enable Logging should be checked if you want a log file generated (within the same directory) that saves a list of all the commands with different send times.
- Once you click start then click wherever you would like the AutoTyper to type to (e.g. Discord message box). 

<i>Example</i><BR>
If I type "Pizza" in the text box, set the interval delay for 10 seconds, and set the random threshold between 100 - 600 then "Pizza" would be typed at 10.1 seconds then 10.3 seconds then 10.6 seconds (all in random order based on the thresholds that you set). 

# Use Cases
Can be used in applications such as Discord where you may need to automate typing certain text.
